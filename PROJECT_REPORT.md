# Secure Password Utility — Project Report

## Project Title
Secure Password Utility (Web Application)

## Abstract / Overview
This project is a web-based password utility that generates cryptographically secure passwords and analyzes password strength in real time. It uses a single-page UI for the generator and analyzer, backed by a Flask API that performs all security-sensitive logic in memory. Password data is never stored or logged.

## Problem Statement
Users often create weak or predictable passwords and lack immediate feedback on password strength. There is a need for a secure tool that generates strong passwords, evaluates existing ones, and does so without storing or leaking sensitive data.

## Objectives
- Provide a secure password generator using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
- Offer a detailed password analyzer with scoring, entropy calculation, and pattern detection.
- Maintain a zero-persistence model where passwords are never stored or logged.
- Deliver a responsive web UI with clear feedback and usability features.

## Scope of the Project
- Web UI for password generation and analysis.
- REST API for generation, bulk generation, entropy calculation, and analysis.
- Security-focused backend with rate limiting, input validation, and response headers.
- No user accounts, storage, or server-side password history.

## System Architecture (text-based explanation)
The app follows a client-server model. The browser serves a single-page HTML interface and loads JavaScript modules for the generator, analyzer, and UI controls. These modules call the Flask API with JSON requests. The Flask app routes requests to stateless generator/analyzer/validator components. Middleware enforces JSON input and adds security headers. Results are returned as JSON and rendered in the UI. All password handling stays in memory for the duration of each request.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-CORS, Flask-Limiter.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla).
- **Security:** Python `secrets` module, entropy calculation, pattern detection.
- **Configuration:** Environment variables for runtime settings.

## Methodology / Working Flow
1. The user selects options in the UI (length and character sets) or enters a password to analyze.
2. The frontend makes a JSON request to the appropriate API endpoint.
3. The backend validates the request and invokes the generator/analyzer.
4. Results (passwords, entropy, scores, recommendations) are returned as JSON.
5. The UI updates the display, strength meter, and recommendations in real time.

## Key Features
- Secure password generation with guaranteed character diversity.
- Bulk password generation with copy and download support.
- Real-time entropy calculation and strength rating.
- Pattern detection for common, sequential, keyboard, and repeated patterns.
- Policy-based validation with errors and warnings.
- Dark/light theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts, and responsive UI.
- Security headers, rate limiting, and input validation on the API.

## How to Use
### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in a browser.

### Web UI Usage
- **Generator:** Choose length and character sets, then click **Generate Password**.
- **Analyzer:** Enter a password and click **Analyze Password** to get scores, entropy, and recommendations.
- **Bulk Generation:** Click **Generate Multiple** to create a list, then copy or download it.

### API Endpoints (JSON)
- `POST /api/v1/generate` — Generate a single password.
- `POST /api/v1/generate/bulk` — Generate multiple passwords.
- `POST /api/v1/analyze` — Analyze password strength.
- `POST /api/v1/entropy/calculate` — Calculate entropy for given parameters.
- `GET /api/v1/health` — Health check.

## Implementation Details (high-level)
- The generator uses a cryptographically secure RNG and shuffles output to prevent predictable patterns.
- The analyzer computes entropy, diversity, and a score-based strength level, then estimates crack time.
- Pattern detection checks for common weak strings, sequential runs, keyboard patterns, and repeated characters.
- API endpoints are protected with JSON-only enforcement and consistent error handling.
- Rate limits are applied to generation and analysis endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Balancing security with usability:** The UI keeps controls simple while still enforcing strong defaults and clear feedback.
- **Preventing misuse of the API:** Rate limiting and strict input validation reduce abuse and malformed requests.
- **Maintaining zero persistence:** All password data is handled in memory and never written to disk or logs.

## Results / Outcomes
The project delivers a secure password utility with an easy-to-use web interface, strong cryptographic generation, and comprehensive analysis. The API and UI work together to provide fast feedback without persisting sensitive data.

## Future Enhancements
- Add optional client-side-only mode for offline use.
- Expand pattern detection with language-specific dictionaries.
- Provide configurable policy profiles (e.g., NIST, enterprise presets).
- Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels and screen reader hints).

## Conclusion
This project provides a secure, user-friendly password utility with strong backend security practices and a responsive UI. It meets the core goal of generating and analyzing passwords without persisting sensitive data, while remaining extensible for future improvements.
